## Concrete-Strength-Prediction
### Problem Statement:
- In this project, the objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its constituent materials.
### Methodology:
- Utilized a regression-based machine learning approach to predict strength of concrete.
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and feature extraction.
- Explored various regression algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, knn, svr, random forests, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting and XG boost.
### Results:
- The Gradient Boosting Regressor outperformed other algorithms, achieving a RMSE of 4.56 N/mm2 on the test data.
- Identified important features influencing concrete strength through feature importance analysis.
### Skills Demonstrated:
- Data preprocessing, data visualization, regression modeling, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation.
### Technologies Used:
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook.
